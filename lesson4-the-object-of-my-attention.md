# The Object of My Attention
At this point, you should have a `%gall` `agent` that can:
* Host a default Earth web page
* Contain a limited data structure
* Print out incoming JSON
You also have a version of TodoMVC that can:
* Authenticate with your Fake Ship
* `poke` your `%gall` `agent` using a new button

In this lesson we're going to work on integrating all of the existing functionality of TodoMVC into our `%gall` `agent` and hooking up the TodoMVC Earth web app to our `agent`. We'll also come up with a way of returning updated `state` to our Earth web app for display. Lastly, we'll move a minified version of our new `tudumvc` to the folder we're hosting through our app. Let's get started!
