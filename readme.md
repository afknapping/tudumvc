# TuduMVC - a React.js + Hooks Implementation of TodoMVC with Urbit Integration

`tudumvc` is an implementation of the React.js + Hooks version of [TodoMVC](https://jacob-ebey.js.org/hooks-todo/#/) that uses Urbit as a back-end.  The Urbit backend supports all of the open-web functionality _including_ serving the front-end without any need for client-side storage.  With minimal changes to the existing source code and less than 300 lines of back-end code, `tudumvc` is responsive, lightweight, and expandable.

Over the course of this guide, we'll get `tudumvc` running on a test ship then investigate the code and learn how we might apply this to other existing applications, or build something from the ground up, on Urbit.

Let's start with creating a ship and getting the app installed:
